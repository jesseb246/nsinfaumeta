INTRODUCTION 

International Rules 

 
The International Rules in this book were formalized in the Convention on 
the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, and 
became effective on July 15, 1977. The Rules (commonly called 72 
COLREGS) are part of the Convention, and vessels flying the flags of states 
ratifying the treaty are bound to the Rules. The United States has ratified 
this treaty and all United States flag vessels must adhere to these Rules 
where applicable. President Gerald R. Ford proclaimed 72 COLREGS and 
the Congress adopted them as the International Navigational Rules Act of 
1977. 
 
The 72 COLREGS were developed by the Inter-Governmental Maritime 
Consultative Organization (IMCO) which in May 1982 was renamed the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO). In November 1981, IMO’s 
Assembly adopted 55 amendments to the 72 COLREGS which became 
effective on June 1, 1983. The IMO also adopted 9 more amendments 
which became effective on November 19, 1989.  The International Rules in 
this book contain these amendments.   
 
These Rules are applicable on waters outside of established navigational 
lines of demarcation. The lines are called COLREGS Demarcation Lines 
and delineate those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the 
Inland and International Rules. COLREGS Demarcation Lines are contained 
in this book.

INTRODUCTION—CONTINUED 

 

Inland Rules 

 
The Inland Rules in this book replace the old Inland Rules, Western Rivers 
Rules, Great Lakes Rules, their respective pilot rules and interpretive rules, 
and parts of the Motorboat Act of 1940. Many of the old navigation rules 
were originally enacted in the last century.  Occasionally, provisions were 
added to cope with the increasing complexities of water transportation. 
Eventually, the navigation rules for United States inland waterways became 
such a confusing patchwork of requirements that in the 1960’s several 
attempts were made to revise and simplify them. These attempts were not 
successful.   
 
Following the signing of the Convention on the International Regulations for 
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, a new effort was made to unify and 
update the various inland navigation rules. This effort culminated in the 
enactment of the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980. This legislation sets 
out Rules 1 through 38— the main body of the Rules. The five Annexes 
were published as regulations.  It is important to note that with the exception 
of Annex V to the Inland Rules, the International and Inland Rules and 
Annexes are very similar in both content and format. 
 
The effective date for the Inland Navigation Rules was December 24, 1981, 
except for the Great Lakes where the effective date was March 1, 1983.

Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility 
(a) This Rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when 

navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility. 

(b) Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing 
circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel 
shall have her engines ready for immediate maneuver. 

(c) Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and 

conditions of restricted visibility when complying with Rules 4 through 10. 

(d) A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel 
shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing or risk of collision 
exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that 
when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the 
following shall be avoided: 

(i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other 
than for a vessel being overtaken; and  
(ii) an alteration of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam. 
(e) Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not 

exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog 
signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a closequarters situation

RULE 34 

Maneuvering and Warning Signals 

(a) When power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or 

crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel 
underway, when maneuvering as authorized or required by these Rules: 

(i) shall indicate that maneuver by the following signals on her whistle: 
one short blast to mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”; two 
short blasts to mean “I intend to leave you on my starboard side”; and 
three short blasts to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”. 
(ii) upon hearing the one or two blast signal of the other shall, if in 
agreement, sound the same whistle signal and take the steps 
necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, from any cause, the 
vessel doubts the safety of the proposed maneuver, she shall sound 
the danger signal specified in paragraph (d) of this Rule and each 
vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing 
agreement is made. 

(b) A vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph 

(a) of this Rule by light signals: 

(i) These signals shall have the following significance: one flash to 
mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”; two flashes to mean “I 
intend to leave you on my starboard side”; three flashes to mean “I am 
operating astern propulsion”; 
(ii) The duration of each flash shall be about 1 second; and 
(iii) The light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or 
yellow light, visible at a minimum range of 2 miles, synchronized with 
the whistle, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I to these 
Rules.

(c) When in sight of one another in a narrow channel or fairway: 

(i) a vessel intending to overtake another shall in compliance with Rule 
9(e)(i) indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle: 

− 

− 

two prolonged blasts followed by one short blast to mean “I intend 
to overtake you on your starboard side”; 
two prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts to mean “I 
intend to overtake you on your port side”. 

(ii) the vessel about to be overtaken when acting in accordance with 
Rule 9(e)(i) shall indicate her agreement by the following signal on her 
whistle: 

−  one prolonged, one short, one prolonged and one short blast, in 

that order. 

(d) When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and 
from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of 
the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other 
to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt 
by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Such signal may 
be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes. 

(e) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other 

vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one 
prolonged blast. Such signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by 
any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or 
behind the intervening obstruction. 

(f) If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 

meters, one whistle only shall be used for giving maneuvering and warning 
signals.

(d)  Directional properties 

The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 
dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis at any direction in 
the horizontal plane within ± 45 degrees of the axis.  The sound pressure 
level at any other direction in the horizontal plane shall be not more than 10 
dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis, so that the range 
in any direction will be at least half the range on the forward axis. The sound 
pressure level shall be measured in that one-third octave band which 
determines the audibility range. 
 
(e)  Positioning of whistles 

When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on a vessel, 

it shall be installed with its maximum intensity directed straight ahead. 

A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to 

reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to 
minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of the 
vessel’s own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB(A) and so far 
as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).

§ 86.07 Directional properties 
The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 
dB below the sound pressure level specified in § 86.05 in any direction in 
the horizontal plane within + 45 degrees of the forward axis. The sound 
pressure level of the whistle in any other direction in the horizontal plane 
shall not be more than 10 dB less than the sound pressure level specified 
for the forward axis, so that the range of audibility in any direction will be at 
least half the range required on the forward axis. The sound pressure level 
shall be measured in that one-third octave band which determines the 
audibility range. 
 
§ 86.09 Positioning of whistles 
(a)  When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on the 

vessel and is permanently installed, it shall be installed with its forward 
axis directed forward. 

(b)  A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to 

reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to 
minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of 
the vessel’s own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB(A) 
and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).

(f)  Fitting of more than one whistle 

If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, it shall 

be so arranged that they are not sounded simultaneously. 
 
(g)  Combined whistle systems 

If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle 
or of one of the whistles referred to in paragraph 1(f) above is likely to have 
a zone of greatly reduced signal level, it is recommended that a combined 
whistle system be fitted so as to overcome this reduction. For the purposes 
of the Rules a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single 
whistle. The whistles of a combined system shall be located at a distance 
apart of not more than 100 meters and arranged to be sounded 
simultaneously. The frequency of any one whistle shall differ from those of 
the others by at least 10 Hz.

§ 86.11 Fitting of more than one whistle 
If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, they shall 
not be sounded simultaneously. 
 
§ 86.13 Combined whistle systems 
(a)  A combined whistle system is a number of whistles (sound emitting 

sources) operated together. For the purposes of the Rules a combined 
whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle.  (b) The whistles of 
a combined system shall: 
(1)  Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters,  
(2)  Be sounded simultaneously,  
(3)  Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of the 

others by at least 10 Hz, and  

(4)  Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length of vessel 

which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistles in the 
combined system having fundamental frequencies falling within the 
limits prescribed in § 86.03, or if there are only two whistles in the 
combined system, by the higher fundamental frequency falling 
within the limits prescribed § 86.03. 

 
NOTE: If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle or of 
one of the whistles referred to in §86.11 is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced 
signal level a combined whistle system should be fitted so as to overcome this 
reduction.

§ 82.1 Purpose 
This part contains the interpretative rules concerning the 72 COLREGS that 
are adopted by the Coast Guard for the guidance of the public. 
 
§ 82.3 Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit 
Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a 
vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they 
are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights under 
Rule 23. A “composite unit” is interpreted to be a pushing vessel that is 
rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being pushed so they 
react to sea and swell as one vessel. 
“Mechanical means” does not include the following: 
(a) Lines. 
(b) Hawsers. 
(c) Wires. 
(d) Chains. 
 
§ 82.5 Lights for moored vessels 
For the purposes of Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS, a vessel at anchor 
includes a barge made fast to one or more mooring buoys or other similar 
device attached to the sea or river floor. Such a barge may be lighted as a 
vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30, or may be lighted on the 
corners in accordance with 33 CFR 88.13. 
 
§ 82.7 Sidelights for unmanned barges 
An unmanned barge being towed may use the exception of COLREG Rule 
24(h). However, this exception only applies to the vertical sector 
requirements.

This part contains the interpretative rules for the Inland Rules.  These 
interpretative rules are intended as a guide to assist the public and promote 
compliance with the Inland Rules. 
 
§ 90.3 Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit 
Rule 24(b) of the Inland Rules states that when a pushing vessel and a 
vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they 
are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights 
prescribed in Rule 23. A “composite unit” is interpreted to be the 
combination of a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead that are 
rigidly connected by mechanical means so they react to sea and swell as 
one vessel. Mechanical means does not include lines, wires, hawsers, or 
chains. 
 
§ 90.5 Lights for moored vessels 
A vessel at anchor includes a vessel made fast to one or more mooring 
buoys or other similar device attached to the ocean floor.  Such vessels may 
be lighted as a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30, or may be 
lighted on the corners in accordance with 33 CFR 88.13.

(a) Whoever operates a vessel, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, in 
violation of this Chapter or of any regulation promulgated pursuant to section 
1607 of this title, shall be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for 
each such violation. 

(b) Every vessel subject to the provisions of this Chapter, other than a public 
vessel being used for noncommercial purposes, which is operated in violation 
of this Chapter or of any regulation promulgated pursuant to section 1607 of 
this title, shall be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each 
such violation, for which penalty the vessel may be seized and proceeded 
against in the district court of the United States of any district within which 
such vessel may be found. 

(c) The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating 
may assess any civil penalty authorized by this section. No such penalty may 
be assessed until the person charged, or the owner of the vessel charged, as 
appropriate, shall have been given notice of the violation involved and an 
opportunity for a hearing. For good cause shown, the Secretary may remit, 
mitigate, or compromise any penalty assessed. Upon the failure of the person 
charged, or the owner of the vessel charged, to pay an assessed penalty, as 
it may have been mitigated or compromised, the Secretary may request the 
Attorney General to commence an action in the appropriate district court of 
the United States for collection of the penalty as assessed, without regard to 
the amount involved, together with such other relief as may be appropriate. 
 

Violations of Inland Navigation Rules and Regulations

ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE 

 
The alternative compliance procedures for the International Rules and the 
Inland Rules are the same, although they appear both in the International 
Rules section of the Code of Federal Regulations (33 CFR Part 81) and in the 
Inland Rules section (33 CFR Part 89). 
 
SEC 
1. Definitions.  
2. General.  
3. Application for a Certificate of 
Alternative Compliance 
 
 
1. Definitions. 
As used in this part: 
“72 COLREGS” refers to the International Regulations for Preventing 

4. Certificate of Alternative Compliance: Contents. 
5. Certificate of Alternative Compliance: Termination. 
6. Record of certification of vessels of special of. 
construction or purpose. 

Collisions at Sea, 1972, done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified by 
the Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, as amended. 

“Inland Rules” refers to the Inland Navigation Rules contained in the Inland 

Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-591) and the technical annexes 
established under that Act. 

“A vessel of special construction or purpose” means a vessel designed or 

modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is thereby 
made relatively inflexible. 

“Interference with the special function of the vessel” occurs when installation 

or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling  appliances under the 72 
COLREGS/Inland Rules prevents or significantly hinders the operation in 
which the vessel is usually engaged. 

 
2. General. 

Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply with 

the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of the 72 COLREGS / Inland 
Rules without interfering with their special function may instead meet 
alternative requirements. The Chief of the Marine Safety Division in each 
Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that 
alternative compliance be as close as possible with the 72 COLREGS / Inland 
Rules. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be 
certified for alternative compliance. 
 
3. Application for a Certificate of Alternative Compliance. 

(a) The owner, builder, operator, or agent of a vessel of special construction 

or purpose who believes the vessel cannot fully comply with

 

204 

the 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules light, shape, or sound signal provisions 
without interference with its special function may apply for a determination 
that alternative compliance is justified. The application must be in writing, 
submitted to the Chief of the Marine Safety Division of the Coast Guard 
District in which the vessel is being built or operated, and include the following 
information: 

(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. 
(2) The identification of the vessel by its: 

(i) Official number; 
(ii) Shipyard hull number; 
(iii) Hull identification number; or 
(iv) State number, if the vessel does not have an official number or 

hull identification number. 

(3) Vessel name and home port, if known. 
(4) A description of the vessel’s area of operation. 
(5) A description of the provision for which the Certificate of Alternative 
Compliance is sought, including: 

(i) The 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules Rule or Annex section number for 

which the Certificate of Alternative Compliance is sought; 

(ii) A description of the special function of the vessel that would be 

interfered with by full compliance with the provision of that Rule or 
Annex section; and (iii) A statement of how full compliance would 
interfere with the special function of the vessel. 

(6) A description of the alternative installation that is in closest possible 
compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules Rule or 
Annex section. 
(7) A copy of the vessel’s plans or an accurate scale drawing that clearly 
shows— 

(i) The required installation of the equipment under the 72 

(ii) The proposed installation of the equipment for which certification is 

(iii) Any obstructions that may interfere with the equipment when 

COLREGS/Inland Rules, 

being sought, and 

installed in: 
(A) The required location; and 
(B) The proposed location. 

(b) The Coast Guard may request from the applicant additional information 

concerning the application. 

 

205 

4. Certificate of Alternative Compliance: Contents. 

The Chief of the Marine Safety Division issues the Certificate of Alternative 
Compliance to the vessel based on a determination that it cannot comply fully 
with 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules light, shape, and sound signal provisions 
without interference with its special function. 
This Certificate includes: 

(a) Identification of the vessel as supplied in the application; 
(b) The provision of the 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules for which the Certificate 

authorizes alternative compliance; 

(c) A certification that the vessel is unable to comply fully with the 72 

COLREGS/Inland Rules light, shape, and sound signal requirements without 
interference with its special function; 

(d) A statement of why full compliance would interfere with the special 

function of the vessel; 

(e) The required alternative installation; 
(f) A statement that the required alternative installation is in the closest 

possible compliance with the 72 COLREGS/Inland Rules without interfering 
with the special function of the vessel; 

(g) The date of issuance; 
(h) A statement that the Certificate of Alternative Compliance terminates 

when the vessel ceases to be usually engaged in the operation for which the 
certificate is issued. 
 
5. Certificate of Alterative Compliance: Termination. 
The Certificate of Alternative Compliance terminates if the information 
supplied under 3.(a) or the Certificate issued under 4 is no longer applicable 
to the vessel. 
 
6. Record of certification of vessels of special construction or purpose. 

(a) Copies of Certificates of Alternative Compliance and documentation 

concerning Coast Guard vessels are available for inspection at the offices of 
Assistant Commandant for Marine Safety and Environmental Protection, U.S. 
Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 
20593-0001. 

(b) The owner or operator of a vessel issued a certificate shall ensure that 
the vessel does not operate unless the Certificate of Alternative Compliance 
or a certified copy of that certificate is on board the vessel and available for 
inspection by Coast Guard personnel.

26.06 Maintenance of radiotelephone; 
failure of radiotelephone. 
26.07 Communications. 
26.08 Exemption procedures. 
26.09 List of exemptions. 

(a) The purpose of this part is to implement the provisions of the Vessel 

Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act. This part: 

(1) Requires the use of the vessel bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone; 
(2) Provides the Coast Guard’s interpretation of the meaning of important 
terms in the Act; 
(3) Prescribes the procedures for applying for an exemption from the Act 
and the regulations issued under the Act and a listing of exemptions. 

(b) Nothing in this part relieves any person from the obligation of complying 

with the rules of the road and the applicable pilot rules. 
 
§ 26.02 Definitions. 
For the purpose of this part and interpreting the Act: 
“Secretary” means the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard 

is operating; 

sections 1201-1208; 

“Act” means the “Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act”, 33 U.S.C. 

“Length” is measured from end to end over the deck excluding sheer; 
“Power-driven vessel” means any vessel propelled by machinery; 
“Towing vessel means any commercial vessel engaged in towing another 

vessel astern, alongside, or by pushing ahead; 

“Vessel Traffic Services (VTS)” means a service implemented under Part 161 
of this chapter by the United States Coast Guard designed to improve the 
safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect the environment. 

The VTS has the capability to interact with marine traffic and respond to traffic 

situations developing in the VTS area; and 

“Vessel Traffic Service Area or VTS Area” means the geographical area 

encompassing a specific VTS area of service as described in Part 161 of 
this chapter. This area of service may be subdivided into 

 

208 

sectors for the purpose of allocating responsibility to individual Vessel 
Traffic Centers or to identify different operating requirements. 

 
Note: Although regulatory jurisdiction is limited to the navigable waters of the United 
States, certain vessels will be encouraged or may be required, as a condition of port 
entry, to report beyond this area to facilitate traffic management within the VTS area. 
 
§ 26.03 Radiotelephone required. 

(a) Unless an exemption is granted under §26.09 and except as provided in 

paragraph (a) (4) of this section, this part applies to: 

(i) Every power-driven vessel of 20 meters or over in length while 

(ii)  Every vessel of 100 gross tons and upward carrying one or more 

passengers for hire while navigating; 

(iii) Every towing vessel of 26 feet or over in length while navigating; 

navigating; 

and 

(iv) Every dredge and floating plant engaged in or near a channel or 
fairway in operations likely to restrict or affect navigation of other 
vessels except for an unmanned or intermittently manned floating 
plant under the control of a dredge. 

(b) Every vessel, dredge, or floating plant described in paragraph (a) of this 

section must have a radiotelephone on board capable of operation from its 
navigational bridge, or in the case of a dredge, from its main control station, 
and capable of transmitting and receiving on the frequency or frequencies 
within the 156-162 Mega-Hertz band using the classes of emissions 
designated by the Federal Communications Commission for the exchange of 
navigational information.   

(c) The radiotelephone required by paragraph (b) of this section must be 

carried on board the described vessels, dredges, and floating plants upon the 
navigable waters of the United States. 

(d) The radiotelephone required by paragraph (b) of this section must be 

capable of transmitting and receiving on VHF FM channel 22A (157.1 MHz). 

(e) While transiting any of the following waters, each vessel described in 

paragraph (a) of this section also must have on board a radiotelephone 
capable of transmitting and receiving on VHF FM channel 67 (156.375 MHz): 

(1) The lower Mississippi River from the territorial sea boundary, and 
within either the Southwest Pass safety fairway or the South Pass safety 
fairway specified in 33 CFR 166.200, to mile 242.4 AHP (Above Head of 
Passes) near Baton Rouge; 
(2) The Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet from the territorial sea boundary, 
and within the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Safety Fairway specified in 
33 CFR 166.200, to that channel’s junction with the Inner Harbor 
Navigation Canal; and 

 

209 

(3) The full length of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal from its junction 
with the Mississippi River to that canal’s entry to Lake Pontchartrain at 
the New Seabrook vehicular bridge. 

(f) In addition to the radiotelephone required by paragraph (b) of this section, 

each vessel described in paragraph (a) of this section while transiting any 
waters within a Vessel Traffic Service Area, must have on board a 
radiotelephone capable of transmitting and receiving on the VTS designated 
frequency in Table 26.03(f) (VTS Call Signs, Designated Frequencies, and 
Monitoring Areas) . (Located on pages 214 and 215.) 
 
Note: A single VHF FM radio capable of scanning or sequential monitoring (often 
referred to as “dual watch” capability) will not meet the requirements for two radios. 
 
§ 26.04 Use of the designated frequency. 

(a) No person may use the frequency designated by the Federal 

Communications Commission under section 8 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1207(a), 
to transmit any information other than information necessary for the safe 
navigation of vessels or necessary tests. 

(b) Each person who is required to maintain a listening watch under section 

5 of the Act shall, when necessary, transmit and confirm, on the designated 
frequency, the intentions of his vessel and any other information necessary 
for the safe navigation of vessels. 

(c) Nothing in these regulations may be construed as prohibiting the use of 

the designated frequency to communicate with shore stations to obtain or 
furnish information necessary for the safe navigation of vessels. 

(d) On the navigable waters of the United States, channel 13 (156.65 MHz) 

is the designated frequency required to be monitored in accordance with 
§26.05(a) except that in the area prescribed in §26.03(e), channel 67 
(156.375 MHz) is an additional frequency.   

(e) On those navigable waters of the United States within a VTS area, the 

designated VTS frequency is the designated frequency required to be 
monitored in accordance with §26.05. 
 
Note: As stated in 47 CFR 80.148(b), a VHF watch on Channel 16 (156.800Mhz) is not 
required on vessels subject to the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act and 
participating in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) system when the watch is maintained on 
both the vessel bridge-to-bridge frequency and a designated VTS frequency. 
 
§ 26.05 Use of Radiotelephone. 

Section 5 of the Act states that the radiotelephone required by this 

Act is for the exclusive use of the master or person in charge of the vessel, or 
the person designated by the master or person in charge  

 

210 

to pilot or direct the movement of the vessel, who shall maintain a listening 
watch on the designated frequency. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as 
precluding the use of portable radiotelephone equipment to satisfy the 
requirements of this Act. 
 
§ 26.06 Maintenance of radiotelephone; failure of radiotelephone. 

Section 6 of the Act states that whenever radiotelephone capability is 

required by this Act, a vessel’s radiotelephone equipment shall be maintained 
in effective operating condition. If the radiotelephone equipment carried 
aboard a vessel ceases to operate, the master shall exercise due diligence to 
restore it or cause it to be restored to effective operating condition at the 
earliest practicable time. The failure of a vessel’s radiotelephone equipment 
shall not, in  itself, constitute a violation of this Act, nor shall it obligate the 
master of any vessel to moor or anchor his vessel; however, the loss of 
radiotelephone capability shall be given consideration in the navigation of the 
vessel. 
 
§ 26.07 Communications. 

No person may use the services of, and no person may serve as, a person 

required to maintain a listening watch under section 5 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 
1204, unless the person can communicate in the English language. 
 
§ 26.08 Exemption procedures. 

(a) The Commandant has redelegated to the Assistant Commandant for 

Marine Safety and Environmental Protection, U.S. Coast Guard 
Headquarters, with the reservation that this authority shall not be further 
redelegated, the authority to grant exemptions from provisions of the Vessel 
Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act and this part. 

(b) Any person may petition for an exemption from any provision of the Act 

or this part; 

(c) Each petition must be submitted in writing to U.S. Coast Guard, Marine 

Safety and Environmental Protection, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, 
D.C. 20593-0001, and must state: 

(1) The provisions of the Act or this part from which an exemption is 
requested; and  
(2) The reasons why marine navigation will not be adversely affected if 
the exemption is granted and if the exemption relates to a local 
communication system how that system would fully comply with the 
intent of the concept of the Act but would not conform in detail if the 
exemption is granted. 

 

211 

§ 26.09 List of Exemptions. 

(a) All vessels navigating on those waters governed by the navigation rules 
for the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters (33 U.S.C. 241 
et seq.) are exempt from the requirements of the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge 
Radiotelephone Act and this part until May 6, 1975. 

(b) Each vessel navigating on the Great Lakes as defined in the Inland 
Navigation Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.) and to which the 
Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (33 U.S.C.  1201-1208) applies 
is exempt from the requirements in 33 U.S.C.  1203, 1204, and 1205 and the 
regulations under §§26.03, 26.04, 26.05, 26.06, and 26.07. Each of these 
vessels and each person to whom 33 U.S.C. 1208(a) applies must comply 
with Articles Vll, X, Xl, Xll, XlIl, XV, and XVI and Technical Regulations 1-9 of 
“The Agreement Between the United States of America and Canada for

Notes 

1.  VTS regulations are denoted in 33 CFR 
Part 161. All geographic coordinates (latitude 
and longitude) are expressed in North 
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). 

In the event of a communication failure 

2. 
either by the vessel traffic center or the vessel 
or radio congestion on a designated VTS 
frequency, communications may be 
established on an alternate VTS frequency. 
The bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency 
156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is monitored in 
each VTS area; and it may be used as an 
alternate frequency, however, only to the 
extent that doing so provides a level of safety 
beyond that provided by other means. 

3.  Designated frequency monitoring is 
required within U.S. navigable waters. In areas 
which are outside the U.S. navigable waters, 
designated frequency monitoring is voluntary.  
However, prospective VTS Users are 
encouraged to monitor the designated 
frequency. 

4.  VMRS participants shall make their initial 
report (Sail Plan) to New York Traffic on 
Channel 11 (156.550 MHz). All other reports, 
including the Final Report, shall be made on 
Channel 14 (156.700 MHz.). VMRS and other 
VTS Users shall monitor Channel 14 (156.700 
MHz) while transiting the VTS area. New York 
Traffic may direct a vessel to monitor and 
report on either primary frequency depending 
on traffic density, weather conditions, or other 
safety factors. This does not require a vessel 
to monitor both primary frequencies. 

5.  A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service was 
established by the United States and Canada 
within adjoining waters. The appropriate 
vessel traffic center administers the rules 
issued by both nations; however, it will enforce 
only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction. 

6.  Seattle Traffic may direct a vessel to 
monitor the other primary VTS frequency 
156.250 MHz or 156.700 MHz (Channel 5A or 
14) depending on traffic density, weather 
conditions, or other safety factors, rather than 
strictly adhering to the designated frequency 
required for each monitoring area as defined 
above. This does not require a vessel to 
monitor both primary frequencies. 

7.  A portion of Tofino Sector’s monitoring 
area extends beyond the defined CVTS area. 
Designated frequency monitoring is voluntary 
in these portions outside of VTS jurisdiction, 
however, prospective VTS Users are 
encouraged to monitor the designated 
frequency. 

8.  The bridge-to-bridge navigational 
frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13), is used 
in these VTSs because the level of radio-
telephone transmissions does not warrant a 
designated VTS frequency. The listening 
watch required by 26.05 of this chapter is not 
limited to the monitoring area.
